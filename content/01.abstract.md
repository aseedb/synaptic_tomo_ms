## Abstract {.page_break_before}
Synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion with the plasma membrane (PM) proceeds through intermediate steps that remain poorly resolved. 
The effect of persistent high or low exocytosis activity on intermediate steps remains unknown. 
Using time-resolved cryo-electron tomography we observed events following synaptic stimulation at nanometer resolution in near native samples. 
Our data strongly suggest that during the stage that immediately follows stimulation, termed early fusion, PM and SV membrane curvature changes to establish a point contact. 
The next stage - late fusion - shows fusion pore opening and SV collapse. 
During early fusion, proximal tethered SVs form additional tethers with the PM and increase the inter-SV connector number. In the late fusion stage, PM-proximal lose their interconnections, allowing them to move towards the PM. 
Two SNAP-25 mutations, one arresting and one disinhibiting spontaneous release, caused connector loss. 
The disinhibiting mutation caused a loss of membrane proximal multiple-tethered SVs. 
Overall, tether formation and connector dissolution are triggered by stimulation and respond to the spontaneous fusion rate. 
These morphological observations likely correspond to SV transition from one functional pool to another.
