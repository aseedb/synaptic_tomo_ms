## Discussion
Due to its transient nature, SV exocytosis has been difficult to characterize morphologically. 
A number of questions remain partially unresolved to this date. 
In particular, it has been suggested that following Ca^2+^ entry, the insertion of synaptotagmin-1 in the membrane induces an increase in membrane curvature, which lowers the energy barrier of fusion. 
Such membrane deformation has been observed in biochemically reconstituted models of exocytosis but has not yet been reported in functional synapses [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2010.02.017;@doi:10.1002/embr.201337807]. 
Moreover, it is not clear whether membrane deformation occurs subsequently to Ca^2+^ influx or if primed SVs and their PM counterpart present such deformation [@doi:10.1002/embr.201337807].
The optimal sample preservation delivered by cryo-ET makes it possible to investigate the role of tethers located between SVs and the AZ PM and the function of inter-SV connectors.
Combining cryo-ET with spray-mixing plunge-freezing enabled us to investigate the morphological changes occuring immediately after depolarization.

### Membrane curvature increases following depolarization
Depolarization through spraying droplets of KCl solution on synaptosomes milliseconds before freezing allowed us to capture snapshots of exocytosis (Figure {@fig:membrane_morphology}B1-B3). 
We observed that the curvature of the PM facing some SVs increased following depolarization.
The SV facing such a PM buckling also seemed to get kinked. 
These deformations were not seen in non sprayed synaptosomes. 
This indicates that in functional synapses exocytosis starts with a Ca^2+^-dependent membrane deformation. 
The latter may be caused by the intercalation of synaptotagmin-1 C2A and C2B domains between membrane head groups. 
A recent biophysical study indicated that C2A and C2B preferably insert in SV membrane and PM, respectively [@doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2019.06.016]. 
It may also be due to the tension induced by SNARE-complex zippering [@doi:10.1038/sj.emboj.7601003;@doi:10.1016/j.neulet.2020.134834]. 
Subsequent snapshots showed a fuzzy contact point between the SV and the PM, which likely corresponds to the merging of the two membranes.
Membrane fusion then occurred and yielded classical Ω-figures with variable neck diameters.
Finally, nearly fully collapsed SVs were imaged. 
Overall our observations support the standard model of full collapse membrane fusion and reveal details of exocytosis early stage, prior to actual membrane fusion.

### SV local concentration correlates with SV connectivity
SV local concentration - a.k.a SV occupancy - is tightly correlated with the distance from the AZ PM. Under resting conditions, SV occupancy reaches a local maximum at 25 nm and a local minimum at 75 nm, before rising again with the distance increasing (Figure {@fig:vesicle_distribution}A and B), in agreement with previous reports [@doi:10.1083/jcb.200908082].
By definition, all SVs in the proximal region are directly facing the PM.
Their high concentration can be attributed to the fact that more than 50% of them are tethered to the PM since SV tethering is generally considered as a mostly irreversible process.
On the other hand, the number of connectors per SV and SV connectivity gradually increases with the distance from the AZ (Figure {@fig:connectors}A-D). 
This increase correlates with the increase in occupancy.
Thus, we may hypothesize that SV local concentration is a function for their level of tethering to the PM and of connection with other SVs.
Interestingly, under short stimulation of a few ms, SV occupancy only decreases in the proximal region, as a consequence of the fusion of SVs with the PM (Figure {@fig:vesicle_distribution}B).
In order to further assess the relation between SV tethering, connectivity, and occupancy, we analyzed synapses bearing expressing either WT SNAP-25, a more positively charged mutant (4K), or a more negatively charged mutant (4E) [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2019.01.103]. 
The 4K mutant has a decreased energy barrier to membrane fusion and presents constitutively active exocytosis, whereas the 4E mutant shows a decreased exocytotic activity in reason of a higher energy barrier to membrane fusion.
Both mutants had a significantly decreased proximal SV occupancy (Figure {@fig:vesicle_distribution}A).
In the case of the 4K mutant, this was probably due to the high frequency of spontaneous exocytosis.
On the other hand, the 4E mutant, in reason of its addition negative charges, tends to repel SVs from the PM (Figure {fig:vesicle_distribution}C}, which can explain their decreased proximal occupancy.
Over a narrow distance range, around 75 nm, SV occupancy of both mutants was significantly higher than that of the WT.
Further away, SV occupancy was most significantly lower for the 4E mutants than for the WT.
The 4K mutant showed followed the same trend but had a massive increase of SV occupancy between 500 and 600 nm, before falling again. 
Interestingly, the number of connector per SV follows a similar pattern as SV occupancy in both mutants.
In the 4E mutant, it remains significantly lower than in the WT from approximately 200 nm and beyond.
In the 4K mutant, this value is significantly lower than in the WT from approximately 100 nm but it then rises close to WT values from approximately 400 nm onward.
Our data show that strong disturbances in exocytotic activity lead to profound differences in SV occupancy and SV connectivity.
We note that a correlation exists between SV connectivity and concentration.
Future studies will be necessary to assess whether SV concentration depends on the SV connectivity and to decipher the molecular mechanism influencing these parameters.
`Do we want to speculate about recycling pool and reserve pool? Jakob, do you have any data on how they are affected by the SNAP-25 mutations?`{.green}


### SNAP-25 4K mutant further supports the RRP morphological definition
Previously we showed that the number of tethers of a SV defines whether its exocytosis can be induced by  treatment with a hyperosmotic sucrose solution, which corresponds to a definition of the RRP [@doi:10.1083/jcb.200908082;@doi:10.1016/j.sbi.2019.01.008].
We reported that SVs with at least 3 tethers belong to the RRP according to this definition. 
In order to further assess this model, we futher analyzed synapses of neurons expressing the SNAP-25 mutants.
17% of the WT proximal SVs had 3 tethers or more.
Critically, the 4K mutant had none such SV.
As the RRP (assessed with hyperosmotic sucrose treatment) in this mutant was formerly shown through functional assays to be depleted, our present observation further supports our morphological definition of the RRP [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2019.01.103].  
15% of the proximal SVs had 3 tethers or more in the 4E mutant, which is very similar to the WT situation, while this mutant was shown to possess a normal-sized RRP. 
Our observations are also consistent with a number of studies that have concluded that SV exocytosis requires a minimum of three SNARE complexes [@doi:10.1074/jbc.m109.047381;@doi:10.1126/science.1193134;@doi:10.1126/science.1214984].

### Depolarization induces tethering and a transient increase in RRP size
We then compared SV tethering before and shortly after depolarization. 
Interestingly, the fraction of proximal SVs that were tethered increased by 50% shortly after stimulation, in synapses showing early signs of exocytosis. 
Simultaneously, the number of tethers per proximal SV more than doubled.
Even more strikingly, the fraction of proximal SVs with 3 or more tethers more then tripled. 
In presynaptic terminals presenting more advanced stages of exocytosis (Ω-figures), all these measurements returned to pre-stimulation values. 
These data indicate that immediately after the onset of stimulation a quick and massive increase in tethering occurs. 
This phenomenon leads to some free proximal SVs becoming tethered to the AZ PM, while some previously single- or double-tethered SVs enter the RRP by gaining additional tether(s). 
Interestingly, a number of recent publications have revisited the notion of RRP and suggested that variable exocytosis kinetics exist among RRP SVs [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1606383113;@doi:10.1073/pnas.1314427110;@doi:10.1016/j.neuron.2015.08.038;@doi:10.7554/eLife.51032]. 
Mounting evidence indicates that some SVs can get extremely quickly primed, or "superprimed", in response to Ca^2+^ influx. 
Furthermore, proximal SVs have been reported to get tethered to the AZ PM as a result of Ca^2+^ rise [@doi:10.3389/fnsys.2019.00030;@doi:10.3389/fnsys.2019.00030]. 
Our morphological observations may correspond to superpriming as well as to  Ca^2+^-dependent tethering.
