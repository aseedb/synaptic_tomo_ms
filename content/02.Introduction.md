## Introduction
In the central nervous system, neurons communicate through the release of neurotransmitters at synapses. This process relies on synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis, i.e. the fusion of SVs with the plasma membrane (PM). This in turn is eminently important for normal brain function such as movement coordination or memory formation.
SV exocytosis involves a sequence of steps [@doi:10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00759.x; @doi:10.1016/j.neuron.2013.10.022]. The vesicle is first docked to the active zone (AZ) PM. Subsequently the exocytosis machinery goes through a maturation process, termed priming, after which the SV is ready to fuse. These SVs form the readily releasable pool (RRP) of SVs. Finally, a calcium influx triggers fusion of the SV with the PM. Docked SVs are defined as the SVs in very close proximity or direct contact with the PM as observed by electron microscopy (EM), whereas priming refers to SV ability to undergo exocytosis immediately upon stimulation. Whether every docked SV is also primed has been debated [@doi:10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00759.x; @doi:10.1016/j.conb.2016.12.012]. A recent high-pressure freezing/freeze-substitution EM study of genetically modified synapses has indicated that vesicles that are in direct contact with the PM, i.e. docked, are primed and belong to the RRP and that this situation occurs downstream of vesicle tethering [@doi:10.1016/j.neuron.2014.10.009]. From a molecular perspective, priming involves several proteins including the SNARE complex (SNAP-25, syntaxin-1, and synaptobrevin-2), Munc13, Munc18, synaptotagmin-1, and complexin [@doi:10.1016/j.neuron.2013.10.022;@doi:10.1146/annurev-biophys-060414-034057]. All three SNAREs form a highly stable tight four-helix bundle, known as trans-SNARE complex, which brings the SV and the PM [@doi:10.1038/26412]. Evidence has suggested that the SNARE complex is only partially zipped in primed SVs [@doi:0.1038/sj.emboj.7601003]. Furthermore, various studies have suggested that at least three SNARE complexes are required for SV to be fusion-competent [@doi:10.1074/jbc.M109.047381;@doi:10.1126/science.1193134;@doi:10.1126/science.1214984]. Synaptotagmin-1 is localized on the SV and was proposed to interact with anionic phospholipids and the t-SNAREs upon Ca^2+^-binding, possibly triggering membrane curvature, followed by a proposed hemifusion step and subsequent fusion[@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2010.02.017]. CHARGES ON THE SNARE

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), which preserves samples to atomic resolution, revealed a somewhat different view, where, under resting conditions, no SV is in direct contact with the PM [@doi:10.1083/jcb.200908082; @doi:10.1016/j.sbi.2019.01.008]. Furthermore, cryo-EM has shown that the majority of AZ-proximal SVs are connected to the AZ PM by short filaments, termed tethers.
