## Introduction
In the central nervous system, neurons communicate through the release of neurotransmitters at synapses. This process relies on synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis, i.e. the fusion of SVs with the plasma membrane (PM). This in turn is eminently important for normal brain function such as movement coordination or memory formation.
