## Results

To analyze the morphological changes occurring in the presynpase shortly after stimulation, we pursued a time-resolved cryo-electron tomography approach.
A 52-mM KCl containing buffer was sprayed with an atomizer to depolarize synaptosomes and stimulate exocytosis milliseconds before vitrification.
The spray droplet size was optimized by cutting a 1-ml pipet tip to a diameter matching an EM grid (3 mm) and fixed to the atomizer glass outlet to disperse the spray (Figure {@fig:workflow}A1).
Furthermore, to achieve a delay of 7 ms between spraying and freezing, the nozzle was set 1-2 mm above the liquid ethane container.
This generated many small spray droplets spread throughout the grid (Figure {@fig:workflow}A2-A4).
Even if sprayed droplets were well distributed throughout the grid, not all synaptosomes were in contact with exocytosis-triggering KCl solution.
Given the very low throughput of cryo-electron tomography, we followed a correlative light and electron microscopy approach.
By cryo-fluorescence microscopy, we identified areas where fluorescently labeled synaptosomes and fluorescent spray droplets were colocalized.
Additionally, phase contrast imaging enabled quality control of the frozen EM grid with respect to ice contamination and ice cracks, as shown previously [@doi:10.1016/j.jsb.2007.07.011].
9 control and 9 stimulated synaptosome tomograms were analyzed.
We restricted our analysis to synaptosomes that possessed a smooth PM, free of signs of rupturing and that had a mitochondrion, as we considered these factors essential for synaptosome function.

In addition, we manipulated the electrostatic state of the SNARE complex through a series of point mutations introduced above and grew primary neurons on EM grids [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2019.01.103] (Figure {@fig:workflow}B1-B4).

Thereby, we could image chronically overactive or depressed synapses and relate presynaptic architectural modifications to different functional states.

### Increased membrane curvature at the onset of exocytosis

We analyzed the morphology of SVs fusing with the AZ PM.
Synaptosomes of a single grid have not all been stimulated for the same duration.
Some synaptosomes have been in contact with the stimulating solution from the moment the droplet touched the grid, while others were not at all in contact with the stimulating solution because no droplet landed close enough to them.
Importantly, some synaptosomes were located near the point of impact of a droplet, in which case, it took some time for KCl to diffuse until the concentration around these synaptosomes rose sufficiently to trigger exocytosis.
Therefore, the time interval between triggering exocytosis and freezing ranged between 0 ms and the interval between spray droplets hitting the grid and freezing, which was comprised between 7 and 35 ms depending on the experiments (Table S2, see also [@pmid:7831735]).

Synaptosomes from both control and sprayed grids were thoroughly analyzed for signs of exocytosis, which consisted of  morphological changes of the AZ PM and the tethered SV occurring upon stimulation, which are described hereafter.
These signs were only detected in synaptosomes from sprayed grids and are presented in the likeliest chronological order.
Upon stimulation, both the vesicle membrane and the PM were slightly bent towards each other (Figure {@fig:membrane_morphology}B1-B3; orange arrows).
These structures, which have previously been reported in liposomes but not in synapses, have been referred to as membrane curvature events [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2010.02.017].
Control synaptosomes (i.e. not sprayed) on the other hand, had a straight PM, and no SV membrane was buckled (Figure {@fig:membrane_morphology}A).
Following membrane bending, we observed contacts between vesicles and the PM bilayer where both membranes lose their clear contours (Figure {@fig:membrane_morphology}C1 & C2; pink arrows).
This was followed by further transitioning states prior to and during pore opening (Figure {@fig:membrane_morphology}D-F; blue arrows).
In the next observed fusion state, the vesicle was wide open (Figure {@fig:membrane_morphology}G), followed by almost completely collapsed vesicles where only a small bump on the PM remained visible (Figure {@fig:membrane_morphology}H).
These structures were not observed in any of the non-sprayed control datasets.

Stimulated synaptosome datasets were divided into early and late fusion stages, respectively, based on the morphology of SV and AZ PM. Synapses showing membrane bending and direct lipid contact between SV and PM without an open pore were classified as early fusion.
Those with an open pore or a remaining small bump of a fully collapsed vesicle were classified as late fusion.

### Synaptic vesicle distribution is impacted by synaptic activity

Non-sprayed rat synaptosomes as well as WT-SNAP-25 mouse cultured neuron synapses showed typical SV distribution, as observed in previous cryo-ET studies (Figure {@fig:vesicle_distribution})[@doi:10.1083/jcb.200908082].
Vesicle occupancy in WT-SNAP-25 synapses was 0.09 in the most proximal zone (0-25 nm from the AZ PM), and peaked to 0.18 in 25-50 nm zone. It then dropped to 0.08 in the intermediate zone (50-75 nm) and rose steadily more distally to reach a plateau of ~0.16 spanning the range of 150 to 250 nm distance.
Finally, SV occupancy gradually decreased as the distance from the AZ increased (Figure {@fig:vesicle_distribution}A).

The absolute values differ between WT cultured mouse neurons and non-stimulated rat synaptosomes but the SV occupancy distribution follows the same pattern.
The difference in absolute values can likely be attributed to the different experimental and animal models used.
Sprayed synaptosomes that were showing early signs of exocytosis had a nearly identical SV occupancy pattern as non-sprayed synaptosomes (Figure {@fig:vesicle_distribution}B, dark blue and gray, respectively).
However, when SV full collapse figures were apparent, SV occupancy in the proximal zone was significantly reduced, whereas SV occupancy further away from the AZ PM was unchanged (Figure {@fig:vesicle_distribution}B, red).
This is consistent with some membrane proximal SVs having engaged in exocytosis, while none of the recycling and reserve pool SVs have.
In order to investigate the consequences of chronic high or low synaptic activity, we investigated the 4E and 4K mutants (Figure {@fig:vesicle_distribution}A, green and gold, respectively).
In the most proximal 50 nm, SV were significantly less concentrated in the constitutively depressed 4E mutant than in the WT.
However, they were significantly more abundant between 75 and 100 nm.
Furthermore, proximal SVs were in average more distant to the AZ PM in the 4E mutant than in the WT (Figure {@fig:vesicle_distribution}C).
These observations are consistent with the repulsion between SVs and the PM induced by the additional negative charges in SNAP-25. In the most distal zones, SV occupancy gradually decreased in the 4E mutant and was significantly lower than in the WT over most of the 250 to 750 nm distance range.
The decrease may reflect deleterious effects associated with abnormally low synaptic activity.
The 4K mutant displayed a significantly decreased SV occupancy in comparison to the WT in the most proximal 50 nm.
4K proximal SVs were in average more located further away from the AZ PM than WT proximal SVs (Furthermore, proximal SVs were in average more distant to the AZ PM in the 4E mutant than in the WT (Figure {@fig:vesicle_distribution}C).
This can be readily attributed to the high probability of spontaneous exocytosis generated by the additional positive charges of the SNARE bundle.
Between 50 nm and 75 nm away from the AZ PM, SV occupancy was higher in the 4K mutant than in the WT, consistent with recycling pool SVs being recruited.
From 100 to 250 nm, SV occupancy dropped steadily, in contrary to the WT, and from a distance of 170 nm, it was significantly lower.
Yet, beyond 250 nm, it rose linearly until 450 nm, becoming indistinguishable from WT occupancy, and then experienced a sharp increase, peaking to 0.2 at a distance of 550 nm, significantly higher than WT occupancy, before dropping quickly and significantly lower than WT occupancy.
The overall decrease in the distal areas likely reflects the facts that the reserve pool in the 4K mutant is severely depleted.

### RRP size evolution following stimulation

As stated in the introduction, SVs that are linked by more than 2 tethers to the AZ PM have been suggested to belong to the RRP.
We investigated the tethering state of proximal SVs (i.e. the SVs whose center is located within 45 nm of the AZ PM) prior and following stimulation in synaptosomes.
In non-sprayed synaptosomes, 54% of the proximal vesicles were tethered, which is in agreement with previous results (Supplementary Figure {@fig:suppl*histograms}B) [@doi:10.1083/jcb.200908082].
`\_this is a bit confusing because fig S1B does not directly show this. It shows that the fraction of untethered proximal SVs. The reader needs to calculate the fraction of tethered vesicles = 1 - fraction of untethered vesicles*`{.green} Interestingly, in the early fusion group the fraction of tethered proximal vesicles significantly increased to 80% (P<0.05, χ^2^ test). In the late fusion group, however, 53% of the proximal vesicles were tethered, which is not significantly different to the non sprayed group. The average number of tethers per proximal SV followed the same pattern. Proximal SVs had 0.89 ± 0.12 tethers in the non-sprayed group (Figure {@fig:tethers}D). `mention in methods that ± values are standard error of the mean`{.yellow}.
This parameter rose to 2.09 ± 0.33 in the early fusion group, while it returned to 1.00 ± 0.20 in the late fusion group.

We then analyzed whether the decreased occupancy in the late fusion group was associated with a decreased number of RRP SVs.
In resting, non-sprayed synapses 8% of the proximal SVs resided in the RRP (Figure {@fig:tethers}B).
This agrees with typical RRP size estimates based on electrophysiological measurements.
Surprisingly, the fraction of proximal SVs belonging to the RRP drastically increased to 29% in the early fusion group (P<0.001, χ^2^ test).
The fraction decreased to 13% in the late fusion group.
This, coupled to the 3-fold RRP-size increase in the early fusion group suggests that upon stimulation some proximal SVs very rapidly acquire new tethers, enter the RRP and become primed for exocytosis.
Furthermore, the lower proximal vesicle occupancy in the late fusion group indicates that under our stimulation conditions, replenishing vesicles to the proximal zone is slower than their release.

The situation in the WT-SNAP-25 neurons was similar to unstimulated synaptosomes.
53% of the all proximal SVs were tethered and 17% of all proximal SVs belonged to the RRP (Supplementary Figure {fig:suppl_histograms}A and Figure {fig:tethers}A).
In average, proximal SVs had 1.17 ± 0.23 tethers.
The corresponding values for the 4E mutants were not significantly different (15% and 0.96 ± 0.18, respectively).
However, In all 4K mutant datasets there was not a single SV that was part of the RRP (0.41 ± 0.15 Figure {@fig:tethers}A).
Consistently, the number of tethers per proximal SV was significantly lower in the 4K mutant than in the WT (Figure {@fig:tethers}C.
These results are in line with physiological measurements that have shown that the RRP is depleted in the chronically spontaneously active 4K mutant, and they provide additional evidence that RRP-vesicles have at least 3 tethers. [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2019.01.103].

### Synaptic activity modifies inter-SV connectivity

The majority of SV are linked to other SVs through so-called connectors [@doi:10.1083/jcb.200908082; @doi:10.1016/j.sbi.2019.01.008]. The function and composition of connectors are not clear yet.
It is generally assumed that synapsin is involved in connector formation and may be one of its components.
It has been suggested that connectors reduce SV mobility and maintain a local high SV concentration in the presynpase.
The connectivity level of an individual SV might be one of the factors defining the pool to which the SV belongs.
To shed some light on the role of connectors, we analyzed SV connectivity in our datasets.
We focused most of our analysis to the SVs located at distance of the AZ PM lower than 250 nm.
Furthermore, we defined 4 distance groups: proximal (0-45 nm), intermediate (45-75 nm), distal 1 (75-150 nm), distal 2 (150-250 nm), as in previous studies [@doi:10.1083/jcb.200908082 ;@doi:10.1083/jcb.201206063].
We first analyzed synaptosomes.
In non-sprayed synaptosomes datasets, approximately 70% of the proximal and intermediate SVs were connected to other vesicles.
In distal 1 and 2 regions, this value rose to 84 and 87%, respectively.
Similarly, the number of connectors per vesicles significantly increased from the proximal region (1.63 ± 0.13) to the distal 1 region (2.57 ± 0.09, p<0.01) and the distal 2 region (2.78 ± 0.10, p<0.0001) (Figure {@fig:connectors}B).
Sprayed early and late fusion synapses showed a similar pattern, with significantly more connectors per SV in distal 1 region than in proximal region for the late fusion group, and more connectors per SV in distal 2 region for both early and late fusion groups.
Nonetheless, proximal SV connectivity and number of connectors per SV dropped in the late fusion group to 53% (p<0.09, χ^2^ test) and 1.12 ± 0.15 (p<0.05), respectively (Figure {@figure:connectors}B and D).
This decrease originates from tethered SVs.
Indeed, 1.65 ± 0.23 connectors per tethered SVs were found in the non-sprayed group. This number increased to 2.58 ± 0.45 in the early fusion group (P<0.05) and dropped to 0.85 ± 0.25 in the late fusion group (P<0.05), whereas no significant differences were found in the numbers of connnectors per proximal non-tethered SVs (Figure {@fig:connectors}H).
Furthermore, the decrease in proximal connectivity was only observed in SVs not belonging to the RRP, of which only 51.5% of the vesicles were connected as opposed to 72.3% before stimulation (P<0.01, χ^2^ test; Supplementary Figure {@fig:suppl_histograms}J).
Consistently, the number of connectors per non-RRP proximal SV went from 1.64±0.17 in the non-sprayed group, rose significantly to 2.69 ± 0.54 in the early fusion group (P<0.05) and dropped to 0.9±0.19 in the late fusion group (P<0.05) (Figure {@fig:connectors}F).
Taken together, our observations indicate that following depolarization, the number of connectors per proximal single- or double-tethered vesicles (i.e. non-RRP) first increases and then decreases to a value lower than the initial one.
We have seen earlier that the fraction of tethered proximal SVs does not differ between non-sprayed and late fusion synaptosomes.
Thus, our data suggest that establishing connectivity is a slower process than tethering.
We hypothesize that given the free space made in the proximal region after some SVs have fused, non-connected vesicles from the intermediate region diffuse to the proximal zone and become tethered to the AZ PM.
Only subsequently, these newly tethered vesicles get interconnected.
Furthermore, we have observed that connectors remained present between fusing SV and neighbor SV (Supplementary Figure S2 @fig:S2 and Supplementary Movie suppl_histograms).
This, in addition to passive diffusion, can contribute to replenishing the RRP.

We then analyzed SNAP-25 neurons.
For SNAP-25-WT, similarly to non-sprayed synaptosome, the fraction of connected SVs was significantly higher at about 77% in the distal 2 region (p<0.01), albeit the absolute values were overall lower than in synaptosomes (Figure {@fig:connectors}C).
Consistently, the number of connectors per SV in SNAP-25-WT synapses increased from 1.95 ± 0.38 in the proximal region to 3.23 ± 0.21 in the distal 2 region (Figure {@fig:connectors}A, P<0.01).
The fraction of connected SVs in the distal 2 region was significantly lower in the 4E and 4K mutant than in the WT (p<0.05).
Again this was supported by a significantly lower number of connectors per SV in the distal 1 region between the WT and the 4K mutant (P<0.05), and in the distal 2 region between the WT and the 4E mutant (P<0.0001) as well as the 4K mutant (P<0.0001, (Figure {fig:connectors}A).
These results indicate that prolonged abnormal exocytotic activity is correlated with severe changes in intervesicular connectivity in the distal region.
