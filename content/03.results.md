## Results
To analyze the morphological changes occurring in the presynpase shortly after stimulation, we pursued a time-resolved cryo-electron tomography approach.
A 52-mM KCl containing buffer was sprayed with an atomizer to depolarize synaptosomes and stimulate exocytosis milliseconds before vitrification.
The spray droplet size was optimized by cutting a 1-ml pipet tip to a diameter matching an EM grid (3 mm) and fixed to the atomizer glass outlet to disperse the spray (Figure {@fig:workflow}A1).
Furthermore, to achieve a delay of 7 ms between spraying and freezing, the nozzle was set 1-2 mm above the liquid ethane container.
This generated many small spray droplets spread throughout the grid (Figure {@fig:workflow}A2-A4).
Even if sprayed droplets were well distributed throughout the grid, not all synaptosomes were in contact with exocytosis-triggering KCl solution.
Given the very low throughput of cryo-electron tomography, we followed a correlative light and electron microscopy approach.
By cryo-fluorescence microscopy, we identified areas where fluorescently labeled synaptosomes and fluorescent spray droplets were colocalized.
Additionally, phase contrast imaging enabled quality control of the frozen EM grid with respect to ice contamination and ice cracks, as shown previously [@doi:10.1016/j.jsb.2007.07.011].
9 control and 9 stimulated synaptosome tomograms were analyzed. 
We restricted our analysis to synaptosomes that possessed a smooth PM, free of signs of rupturing and that had a mitochondrion, as we considered these factors essential for synaptosome function.

In addition, we manipulated the electrostatic state of the SNARE complex through a series of point mutations introduced above and grew primary neurons on EM grids [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2019.01.103] (Figure {@fig:workflow}B1-B4).

Thereby we could image chronically overactive or depressed synapses and relate presynaptic architectural modifications to different functional states.

### Increased membrane curvature at the onset of exocytosis
We analyzed the morphology of SVs fusing with the AZ PM.
Synaptosomes of a single grid have not all been stimulated for the same duration.
Some synaptosomes have been in contact with stimulating solution from the moment the droplet touched the grid, while some others were not at all in contact with the stimulating solution because no droplet landed close enough to them.
Importantly, some synaptosomes were located near the point of impact of a droplet, in which case, it took some time for KCl to diffuse until the concentration around these synaptosomes rose sufficiently to trigger exocytosis.
Therefore, the time interval between triggering exocytosis and freezing ranged between 0 ms and the interval between spray droplets hitting the grid and freezing, which was comprised between 7 and 35 ms depending on the experiments (Table S2, see also [@pmid:7831735]).

Synaptosomes from both control and sprayed grids were thoroughly analyzed for signs of exocytosis, which consisted of  morphological changes of the AZ PM and the tethered SV occurring upon stimulation, which are described hereafter. 
These signs were only detected in synaptosomes from sprayed grids and are presented in the likeliest chronological order. 
Upon stimulation both the vesicle membrane and the PM were slightly bent towards each other (Figure {@fig:membrane_morphology}B1-B3; orange arrows).
These structures, which have previously been reported in liposomes but not in synapses, have been referred to as membrane curvature events [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2010.02.017]. 
Control synaptosomes (i.e. not sprayed) on the other hand, had a straight PM, and no SV membrane was buckled (Figure {@fig:membrane_morphology}A).
Following membrane bending we observed contacts between vesicles and the PM bilayer where both membranes lose their clear contours (Figure {@fig:membrane_morphology}C1 & C2; pink arrows). 
This was followed by further transitioning states prior to and during pore opening (Figure {@fig:membrane_morphology}D-F; blue arrows). 
In the next observed fusion state, the vesicle was wide open (Figure {@fig:membrane_morphology}G), followed by almost completely collapsed vesicles where only a small bump on the PM remained visible (Figure {@fig:membrane_morphology}H).
These structures were not observed in any of the non-sprayed control datasets.

Stimulated synaptosome datasets were divided into early and late fusion stages, respectively, based on the morphology of SV and AZ PM. Synapses showing membrane bending and direct lipid contact between SV and PM without an open pore were classified as early fusion. 
Those with an open pore or a remaining small bump of a fully collapsed vesicle were classified as late fusion.

### Synaptic vesicle distribution is impacted by synaptic activity
Non-stimulated rat synaptosomes as well as WT-SNAP-25 mouse cultured neuron synapses showed typical SV distribution, as observed in previous cryo-ET studies [@doi:10.1083/jcb.200908082].
Vesicle occupancy was 0.08 in the most proximal zone (0-25 nm from the AZ PM), and peaked to 0.17 in 25-50 nm zone. It then dropped to 0.08 in the intermediate zone (50-75 nm) and rose steadily in the more distal zone to reach a plateau of ~0.16 from a distance of 125 nm (Figure {@fig:vesicle_distribution}). 
These values are for WT-SNAP-25 synapses.
The absolute values differ between cultured mouse neurons and rat synaptosomes and but the SV occupancy distribution follows the very same pattern. The difference in absolute values can likely be attributed to the different experimental and animal models used.
Sprayed synaptosomes that were showing early signs of exocytosis had a nearly identical SV occupancy pattern as non-sprayed synaptosomes. 
However, when SV full collapse figures were apparent, SV occupancy in the proximal zone was significantly reduced, whereas SV occupancy further away from the AZ PM was unchanged.
This is consistent with some membrane proximal SVs having engaged in exocytosis while none of the recycling and reserve pool SVs have.
In order to investigate the consequences of chronic high or low synaptic activity, we investigated the 4E and 4K mutants.
In the proximal, intermediate, and the first distal areas (up to approximately 125 nm away from the AZ PM) SVs followed a similar occupancy pattern in the constitutively depressed 4E mutant. 
This confirmed that the lower  activity of the 4E mutant was not due to a lack of SV availability. In the most distal zones, SV occupancy gradually decreased in the mutant _to become significantly different from a distance of XXX nm_. 
That latter decrease may reflect deleterious effects associated with abnormally low synaptic activity.
 The 4K mutant displayed significantly decreased SV occupancy in the most proximal area (up to 25 nm), which can be readily attributed to the high probability of spontaneous exocytosis generated by the additional positive charges of the SNARE bundle. 
From 25 nm to about 125 nm away from the AZ PM the occupancy pattern was similar to the WT situation. 
Beyond 125 nm occupancy dropped gradually and more steeply than in the case of the 4E mutant.
_From a distance of XXX nm, occupancy was significantly lower than in the WT_.
This decrease can also be explained by the high exocytosis rate, which leads to a depletion of the reserve pool.

### RRP size evolution following stimulation
As stated in the Introduction, SVs that are linked by more than 2 tethers to the AZ PM have been shown to belong to the RRP. 
We investigated the tethering state of proximal SVs (i.e. those SVs within 45 nm of the AZ PM) prior and following stimulation in synaptosomes.
In non-sprayed synaptosomes, 59% of the proximal vesicles were tethered, which is in agreement with previous results [@doi:10.1083/jcb.200908082]. Interestingly, in the early fusion group the fraction of tethered proximal vesicles significantly increased to 80% (P<0.05, χ^2^ test; Figure @fig:tethers). 

FIGURE TETHERS : one panel for fraction of proximal vesicles that are tethered in synaptosomes. One panel for the same but in neurons. Two panels for fraction of proximal vesicles in RRP (one for synaptosomes, one for neurons). Two panels for number of tethers per proximal sv (one for synaptosomes, one for neurons). two panels for swarm plot of vesicle distance.

In the late fusion group, however, 47% of the proximal vesicles were tethered, which is not significantly different to the non sprayed group.
We then analyzed whether the decreased occupancy in the late fusion group was associated with a decreased number of RRP SVs. 
In resting, non-sprayed synapses about 11% of the proximal SVs resided in the RRP.
This agrees with typical RRP size estimates based on electrophysiological measurements.
Surprisingly, the fraction of proximal vesicles belonging to the RRP drastically increased to 36% in the early fusion group (P<0.001, χ^2^ test; Figure @fig:tethers). 
The fraction returned to the initial value of 11% in the late fusion group. 
This 3-fold increase over the baseline RRP SVs in the early fusion group suggests that upon stimulation some proximal SVs very rapidly enter the RRP and become primed for exocytosis.
Furthermore, the lower proximal vesicle occupancy in the late fusion group indicates that under our stimulation conditions, replenishing vesicles to the proximal zone is slower than their release.

The situation in the WT-SNAP-25 neurons was similar to unstimulated synaptosomes. 
53% of the all proximal SVs were tethered and 14% of all proximal SVs belonged to the RRP. WT proximal SVs 
The corresponding values for the 4E mutants were not significantly different. 
However, In all 4K mutant datasets there was not a single SV that was part of the RRP. 
Consistently, the number of tethers per proximal SV was significantly lower in the 4K mutant than in the WT.
These results are in line with physiological measurements that have shown that the RRP is depleted in the chronically spontaneously active 4K mutant, and they provide additional evidence that RRP-vesicles have at least 3 tethers. [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2019.01.103].  
Furthermore, the average distance between proximal SVs and the AZ PM is significantly higher in  the 4K mutant than in the WT, suggesting that vesicles coming into close contact with the AZ PM undergo spontaneous exocytosis, and are depleted.

### Synaptic activity modifies inter-SV connectivity
The majority of SV are connected to other SVs through so-called connectors [@doi:10.1083/jcb.200908082; @doi:10.1016/j.sbi.2019.01.008]. Connector function and composition is not clear yet. 
It is generally assumed that synapsin is involved in connector formation and may be one of its components. 
It has been suggested that connectors reduce SV mobility and maintain a local high SV concentration in the presynpase. 
The connectivity level of an individual SV might be one of the factors defining the pool to which the SV belongs.
To shed some light on the role of connectors we analyzed SV connectivity in our datasets. 
We focused most of _(all?)_ our analysis to the SVs located at distance of the AZ PM lower than 250 nm. 
Furthermore, we defined 4 distance groups: proximal (0-45 nm), intermediate (45-75 nm), distal 1 (75-150 nm), distal 2 (150-250 nm), as in previous studies [@doi:10.1083/jcb.200908082 ;@doi:10.1083/jcb.201206063].
We first analyzed synaptosomes.

FIGURE CONNECTORS. two panels for fraction of proximal vesicles that are connected as a function of distance (distance groups; one for synaptosomes, one for snap-25). two panels for fraction of proximal vesicles that are connected as a function of RRP.

In non-sprayed synaptosomes datasets, approximately 80% of the proximal and intermediate SVs were connected to other vesicles.
In distal 1 and 2 regions, this value rose to 85 and 93%, respectively. sprayed, early and late fusion groups showed a similar pattern with one interesting exception.
Proximal SV connectivity dropped to 58% in the late fusion group (P<0.05, χ^2^ test; Figure @figure:connectors).
This decrease originates from SVs that are not in the RRP of which only 52.9% of the vesicles were connected as opposed to 77.5% before stimulation (P<0.01, χ^2^ test; Figure @fig:connectors).
These results are consistent with an observed decrease in the number of connectors per proximal SV that are not part of the RRP, from 1.81±0.18 connector per SV in the non sprayed group to 0.85±0.16 in the late fusion group (P<0.01, K-W test) (Figure @fig:connectors). 
Connectors between proximal vesicles (Figure @fig:connectors) were found to remain between fusing vesicles (Figure @fig:connectors and Supplementary movie S1).
We hypothesize that given the free space made in the proximal region after some SVs have fused, non-connected vesicles from the intermediate region diffuse to the proximal zone and become tethered to the AZ PM. 
Our data suggest that establishing connectivity is a slower process than tethering.

We then analyzed SNAP-25 mutants. Similarly to non-sprayed synaptosome, the fraction of connected SVs was significantly higher in the distal 2 group, albeit the absolute values were overall lower than in synaptosomes. 
SNAP-25-WT synapses showed a higher level of connectivity in the distal group. 
The fraction of connected SVs in both distal groups was significantly lower in the 4E mutant than in the WT.
In the case of the 4K mutant, the difference was significant in the distal 2 group. 
Consistently, a significantly lower number of connectors per SV was observed in both distal groups of the 4E and the 4K mutants with respect to the WT.
Additionally, the 4E mutant had significantly less connectors per proximal SV than the WT, whereas the 4K mutant had significantly less connectors per intermediate SV than the WT.
These results indicate that prolonged abnormal exocytotic activity is correlated with changes in intervesicular connectivity.
