![**Schematic representation of a spray-mixing plunge-freezing experiment. In a single experiment different synaptosomes get stimulated for between less than 1 ms and 7 ms.** An EM-grid is held by tweezers and is covered with synaptosomes in HBM-solution. A magnified view of a grid squares shows synaptosomes in blue and their synpatic state of three synapsomes is represented on the rightmost part of each panel. Panel (A) represents the situation right after blotting off solution excess. The grid is accelerated towards the spray and the cryogen. Panel (B) shows a snapshot of the experiment when the grid crosses the spray, 7 ms before the freezing. Some fluorescently dyed droplets containing HBM with 52 mM KCl land on the grid and are depicted in green. At this time point, a synaptosome located at the impact point of a droplet is activated and is depicted in dark blue. Panel (C) shows a snapshot 5 ms later, i.e. 2 ms before freezing. As KCl diffuses away from droplet impacts points, another synaptosomes gets activated because, locally KCl concentration has reached reached a concentration to depolarize enough the synaptosome so that voltage-gated calcium chanels open. Panel (D) shows a synaptosome at the time of impact with ethane. 0.1 ms before freezing a third synaptosome got exposed to a high enough concentration of KCl and got stimulated.](images/spray_freeze_workflow.png){#fig:suppl_spray_workflow width="15cm" tag="S1"}
