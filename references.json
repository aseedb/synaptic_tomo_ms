    "abstract": "Glutamatergic synapses show large variations in strength and short-term plasticity (STP). We show here that synapses displaying an increased strength either after posttetanic potentiation (PTP) or through activation of the phospholipase-C–diacylglycerol pathway share characteristic properties with intrinsically strong synapses, such as (\r\n              i\r\n              ) pronounced short-term depression (STD) during high-frequency stimulation; (\r\n              ii\r\n              ) a conversion of that STD into a sequence of facilitation followed by STD after a few conditioning stimuli at low frequency; (\r\n              iii\r\n              ) an equalizing effect of such conditioning stimulation, which reduces differences among synapses and abolishes potentiation; and (\r\n              iv\r\n              ) a requirement of long periods of rest for reconstitution of the original STP pattern. These phenomena are quantitatively described by assuming that a small fraction of “superprimed” synaptic vesicles are in a state of elevated release probability (\r\n              p\r\n              ∼ 0.5). This fraction is variable in size among synapses (typically about 30%), but increases after application of phorbol ester or during PTP. The majority of vesicles, released during repetitive stimulation, have low release probability (\r\n              p\r\n              ∼ 0.1), are relatively uniform in number across synapses, and are rapidly recruited. In contrast, superprimed vesicles need several seconds to be regenerated. They mediate enhanced synaptic strength at the onset of burst-like activity, the impact of which is subject to modulation by slow modulatory transmitter systems.",

    "abstract": "We have examined the cytoskeletal architecture and its relationship with synaptic vesicles in synapses by quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy (QF.DE). The main cytoskeletal elements in the presynaptic terminals (neuromuscular junction, electric organ, and cerebellar cortex) were actin filaments and microtubules. The actin filaments formed a network and frequently were associated closely with the presynaptic plasma membranes and active zones. Short, linking strands approximately 30 nm long were found between actin and synaptic vesicles, between microtubules and synaptic vesicles. Fine strands (30-60 nm) were also found between synaptic vesicles. Frequently spherical structures existed in the middle of the strands between synaptic vesicles. Another kind of strand (approximately 100 nm long, thinner than the actin filaments) between synaptic vesicles and plasma membranes was also observed. We have examined the molecular structure of synapsin 1 and its relationship with actin filaments, microtubules, and synaptic vesicles in vitro using the low angle rotary shadowing technique and QF.DE. The synapsin 1, approximately 47 nm long, was composed of a head (approximately 14 nm diam) and a tail (approximately 33 nm long), having a tadpole-like appearance. The high resolution provided by QF.DE revealed that a single synapsin 1 cross-linked actin filaments and linked actin filaments with synaptic vesicles, forming approximately 30-nm short strands. The head was on the actin and the tail was attached to the synaptic vesicle or actin filament. Microtubules were also cross-linked by a single synapsin 1, which also connected a microtubule to synaptic vesicles, forming approximately 30 nm strands. The spherical head was on the microtubules and the tail was attached to the synaptic vesicles or to microtubules. Synaptic vesicles incubated with synapsin 1 were linked with each other via fine short fibrils and frequently we identified spherical structures from which two or three fibril radiated and cross-linked synaptic vesicles. We have examined the localization of synapsin 1 using ultracryomicrotomy and colloidal gold-immunocytochemistry of anti-synapsin 1 IgG. Synapsin 1 was exclusively localized in the regions occupied by synaptic vesicles. Statistical analyses indicated that synapsin 1 is located mostly at least approximately 30 nm away from the presynaptic membrane. These data derived via three different approaches suggest that synapsin 1 could be a main element of short linkages between actin filaments and synaptic vesicles, and between microtubules and synaptic vesicles, and between synaptic vesicles in the nerve terminals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Synapsin I is a major neuron-specific phosphoprotein that is specifically localized to the cytoplasmic surface of small synaptic vesicles. In the present study, the binding of synapsin I to small synaptic vesicles was characterized in detail. The binding of synapsin I was preserved when synaptic vesicles were solubilized and reconstituted in phosphatidylcholine. After separation of the protein and lipid components of synaptic vesicles under nondenaturing conditions, synapsin I bound to both components. The use of hydrophobic labeling procedures allowed the assessment of interactions between phospholipids and synapsin I in intact synaptic vesicles. Hydrophobic photolabeling followed by cysteine-specific cleavage of synapsin I demonstrated that the head domain of synapsin I penetrates into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. The purified NH2-terminal fragment, derived from the head domain by cysteine-specific cleavage, bound to synaptic vesicles with high affinity confirming the results obtained from hydrophobic photolabeling. Synapsin I binding to synaptic vesicles could be inhibited by the entire molecule or by the combined presence of the NH2-terminal and tail fragments, but not by an excess of either NH2-terminal or tail fragment alone. The purified tail fragment bound with relatively high affinity to synaptic vesicles, though it did not significantly interact with phospholipids. Binding of the tail fragment was competed by holosynapsin I; was greatly decreased by phosphorylation; and was abolished by high ionic strength conditions or protease treatment of synaptic vesicles. The data suggest the existence of two sites of interaction between synapsin I and small synaptic vesicles: binding of the head domain to vesicle phospholipids and of the tail domain to a protein component of the vesicle membrane. The latter interaction is apparently responsible for the salt and phosphorylation dependency of synapsin I binding to small synaptic vesicles.",

The cryoelectron tomography experiments reported in this study indicate that these structures play a prominent role in synaptic vesicle release. Docked synaptic vesicles did not make membrane to membrane contact with the active zone but were instead linked to it by tethers of different length. Our observations are consistent with an exocytosis model in which vesicles are first anchored by long (&gt;5 nm) tethers that give way to multiple short tethers once vesicles enter the readily releasable pool. The formation of short tethers was inhibited by tetanus toxin, indicating that it depends on soluble N-ethyl-maleimide sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor complex assembly. Vesicles were extensively interlinked via a set of connectors that underwent profound rearrangements upon synaptic stimulation and okadaic acid treatment, suggesting a role of these connectors in synaptic vesicle mobilization and neurotransmitter release.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic vesicles are embedded in a complex filamentous network at the presynaptic terminal. Before fusion, vesicles are linked to the active zone (AZ) by short filaments (tethers). The identity of the molecules that form and regulate tethers remains unknown, but Rab3-interacting molecule (RIM) is a prominent candidate, given its central role in AZ organization. In this paper, we analyzed presynaptic architecture of RIM1α knockout (KO) mice by cryo–electron tomography. In stark contrast to previous work on dehydrated, chemically fixed samples, our data show significant alterations in vesicle distribution and AZ tethering that could provide a structural basis for the functional deficits of RIM1α KO synapses. Proteasome inhibition reversed these structural defects, suggesting a functional recovery confirmed by electrophysiological recordings. Altogether, our results not only point to the ubiquitin–proteasome system as an important regulator of presynaptic architecture and function but also show that the tethering machinery plays a critical role in exocytosis, converging into a structural model of synaptic vesicle priming by RIM1α.",

    "abstract": "Extensive research has yielded crucial insights into the mechanism of neurotransmitter release, and working models for the functions of key proteins involved in release. The SNAREs Syntaxin-1, Synaptobrevin, and SNAP-25 play a central role in membrane fusion, forming SNARE complexes that bridge the vesicle and plasma membranes and that are disassembled by NSF–SNAPs. Exocytosis likely starts with Syntaxin-1 folded into a self-inhibited closed conformation that binds to Munc18-1. Munc13s open Syntaxin-1, orchestrating SNARE complex assembly in an NSF–SNAP–resistant manner together with Munc18-1. In the resulting primed state, with partially assembled SNARE complexes, fusion is inhibited by Synaptotagmin-1 and Complexins, which also perform active functions in release. Upon influx of Ca\r\n              2+\r\n              , Synaptotagmin-1 activates fast release, likely by relieving the inhibition caused by Complexins and cooperating with the SNAREs in bringing the membranes together. Although alternative models exist and fundamental questions remain unanswered, a definitive description of the basic release mechanism may be available soon.",

    "abstract": "Encoding continuous sensory variables requires sustained synaptic signalling. At several sensory synapses, rapid vesicle supply is achieved via highly mobile vesicles and specialized ribbon structures, but how this is achieved at central synapses without ribbons is unclear. Here we examine vesicle mobility at excitatory cerebellar mossy fibre synapses which sustain transmission over a broad frequency bandwidth. Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching in slices from VGLUT1Venus knock-in mice reveal 75% of VGLUT1-containing vesicles have a high mobility, comparable to that at ribbon synapses. Experimentally constrained models establish hydrodynamic interactions and vesicle collisions are major determinants of vesicle mobility in crowded presynaptic terminals. Moreover, models incorporating 3D reconstructions of vesicle clouds near active zones (AZs) predict the measured releasable pool size and replenishment rate from the reserve pool. They also show that while vesicle reloading at AZs is not diffusion-limited at the onset of release, diffusion limits vesicle reloading during sustained high-frequency signalling.",

    "abstract": "Chemical synaptic transmission relies on the Ca2+-induced fusion of transmitter-laden vesicles whose coupling distance to Ca2+ channels determines synaptic release probability and short-term plasticity, the facilitation or depression of repetitive responses. Here, using electron- and super-resolution microscopy at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction we quantitatively map vesicle:Ca2+ channel coupling distances. These are very heterogeneous, resulting in a broad spectrum of vesicular release probabilities within synapses. Stochastic simulations of transmitter release from vesicles placed according to this distribution revealed strong constraints on short-term plasticity; particularly facilitation was difficult to achieve. We show that postulated facilitation mechanisms operating via activity-dependent changes of vesicular release probability (e.g. by a facilitation fusion sensor) generate too little facilitation and too much variance. In contrast, Ca2+-dependent mechanisms rapidly increasing the number of releasable vesicles reliably reproduce short-term plasticity and variance of synaptic responses. We propose activity-dependent inhibition of vesicle un-priming or release site activation as novel facilitation mechanisms.\r\n          , \r\n            Cells in the nervous system of all animals communicate by releasing and sensing chemicals at contact points named synapses. The ‘talking’ (or pre-synaptic) cell stores the chemicals close to the synapse, in small spheres called vesicles. When the cell is activated, calcium ions flow in and interact with the release-ready vesicles, which then spill the chemicals into the synapse. In turn, the ‘listening’ (or post-synaptic) cell can detect the chemicals and react accordingly.\r\n            When the pre-synaptic cell is activated many times in a short period, it can release a greater quantity of chemicals, allowing a bigger reaction in the post-synaptic cell. This phenomenon is known as facilitation, but it is still unclear how exactly it can take place. This is especially the case when many of the vesicles are not ready to respond, for example when they are too far from where calcium flows into the cell. Computer simulations have been created to model facilitation but they have assumed that all vesicles are placed at the same distance to the calcium entry point: Kobbersmed et al. now provide evidence that this assumption is incorrect.\r\n            Two high-resolution imaging techniques were used to measure the actual distances between the vesicles and the calcium source in the pre-synaptic cells of fruit flies: this showed that these distances are quite variable – some vesicles sit much closer to the source than others.\r\n            This information was then used to create a new computer model to simulate facilitation. The results from this computing work led Kobbersmed et al. to suggest that facilitation may take place because a calcium-based mechanism in the cell increases the number of vesicles ready to release their chemicals.\r\n            This new model may help researchers to better understand how the cells in the nervous system work. Ultimately, this can guide experiments to investigate what happens when information processing at synapses breaks down, for example in diseases such as epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "A simple method to determine transient conformations of biological molecules is described. The two reactants (e.g. protein complex and ligand) are mixed rapidly by the coalescence of spray droplets containing one component, with a thin, grid-supported aqueous film containing the other. The transient state is then trapped by rapid freezing, and investigated later by cryo-microscopy. Images of conformations associated with reaction times of 1-100 ms can be achieved by adjusting the delay between the droplet impact and freezing. The droplets (typically 1 micron in diameter) are propelled onto the grid by an atomizer spray. It is shown that the droplets impinging on the liquid film spread rapidly over its surface under the influence of surface tension, and only weakly disturb the underlying film, partially displacing its contents away from the point of impact. Experiments with sprayed salt solutions, using vesicles derived from erythrocytes as micro-osmometers, indicate that rapid mixing occurs both through the film and laterally, by diffusion. The spraying process does not produce any detectable concentration changes due to drying in either the droplets or the film, and the method is applicable to high-resolution imaging.",

    "abstract": "A readily releasable pool of quanta, tentatively identified with docked synaptic vesicles, has been defined by analysis of the neurotransmitter release caused by application of hypertonic solutions. The goal of this work is to determine the relationship of this functionally defined readily releasable pool to the one drawn upon by action potential-evoked release. We find that hypertonic solutions do not act through changes in intracellular calcium. Since the release produced by action potentials and hypertonic solutions varies in parallel as the pool size is changed, we conclude that the same pool is shared by both mechanisms. This conclusion, taken together with other observations in the literature, means that the synaptic release probability depends on the size of the readily releasable pool.",
